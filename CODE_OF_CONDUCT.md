# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Using inclusive and welcoming language
- Respecting others' privacy and confidentiality
- Valuing contributions from all community members regardless of experience level

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit consent
- Unwelcome sexual or physical contact of any kind
- Intimidation, stalking, or threatening behavior
- Discrimination or prejudice based on protected characteristics
- Deliberate "outing" or misgendering of individuals
- Sustained disruption of community discussions or events
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories, issues, discussions, and pull requests
- Project documentation and wikis
- Communication channels (Slack, Discord, mailing lists, forums, etc.)
- Project-sponsored events, whether online or in-person
- Official social media accounts and communications
- Any public spaces where an individual is representing this project or community

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

Individuals representing the project in professional settings are also expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in those contexts.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct
- Communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate
- Temporarily or permanently ban any contributor whose behavior violates this Code of Conduct

Community leaders will apply these standards fairly across all community members and will not show favoritism or discrimination in enforcement.

## Reporting Violations

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via:

All complaints will be:

- Reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly
- Kept confidential to the extent possible

When reporting a violation, please provide:

- A detailed description of the incident

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Reports will only be disclosed to those who have a direct need to know in order to investigate and resolve the situation.
